Hugo generates a section tree that matches your content.
A Section is a collection of pages that gets defined based on the organization structure under the content/ directory.

By default, all the first-level directories under content/ form their own sections (root sections).

If a user needs to define a section foo at a deeper level, they need to create a directory named foo with an _index.md file (see Branch Bundles for more information).
